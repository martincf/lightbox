## A few rules to remember
Now that you're a Lightbox Darkroom member, there are a few rules worth stating:

* There's a darkroom hire calendar and booking system available on [Skedda.com](https://lightboxdarkroom.skedda.com). I will set you up as a user and you should receive details in your email. Please book any time in the darkroom here. Any issues using it, drop me an email.
* I'm generally in the area most of the time, so, can make sure the darkroom is ready for when you arrive. I'll issue a key upon arrival.
* Use of the space is on a first-come first-served basis. However, please be reasonable. I may need to ask people to move their time on occassions, but hopefully not too often.
* Chemicals are included (for the time being) in the hire cost. Paper is not included due to the its high price. Let me know if you think any chemicals need replenishing or a new batch mixing.
* Ensure all tanks, jugs, and accessories are thoroughly washed after developing your film(s) and printing.
* And of course, please be careful with the chemicals, knives, and equipment. Enjoy the darkoom!
