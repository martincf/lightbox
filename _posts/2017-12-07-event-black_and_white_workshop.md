**Learn how to develop and then print your own film black and white photography images. The satisfaction and aesthetic beauty of a silver gelatin print cannot be beaten. Come and learn how to create some wonderful imagery, and finish the day with your own prints to frame and/or sell.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures). You can buy black and white 35mm film locally from the [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) or [Wilkinsons Cameras](http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/) in Liverpool, or buy it [online here](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html). If you're really desperate, email me and I can sell a small amount from my own collection.
