excerpt: Ever so close to finishing our darkroom

**We were optimistic of a February launch, it's now March! But we're nearly there...**

After a solid week on-site at the end of February we are now very close to having a room for darkness. Significantly, the floors are down and the walls are almost complete. Laying down the foundations for a floor and then building a floor does take time, of course.

So, what's left to do?

* <strike>Finish the walls</strike>
* <strike>Build the rest of work surfaces</strike>
* Build the all-important darkroom sink unit
* Fit the plumbing and electricity
* Finish the ceiling
* Add in the equipment
* Make it dark and tidy up!

It's now early-April. It's reasonable to expect another month of work and tidying up before we can open Lightbox's doors.
