excerpt: A not so comprehensive list of places to buy film cameras and lenses. Some I've bought from, some I haven't (yet)

In light of forever assessing and wanting to add to an unnecessarily growing collection of film cameras and lenses here’s my list of UK camera shops that I’ve either visited, or ordered from, or just keep checking for that desirable.Those I’ve visited in London

All of the below are easy to get to over a couple of hours. Very useful if you’re in the city hunting for a particular item.

* Mr Cad, nr Victoria Station, London: Worth the visit if only to speak to Alex, Mr Cad, himself. A wonderfully knowledgeable owner with an amazing collection. http://www.mrcad.co.uk
* Camera World, nr Oxford Rd, London: A smaller collection than Mr Cad, but very good. Friendly helpful staff as well. https://www.cameraworld.co.uk
* Aperture, nr Tottenham Court Rd, London: Totally dedicated to buying, selling, and what looks like fixing, film cameras. Also has a smaller shop near the British Museum, with a cafe, camera museum, and selling mainly Hasselblad kit. http://www.apertureuk.com
* Teamwork, nr Tottenham Court Rd, London: mainly high spec large and medium format kit. A shop mainly catering for pro photographers. Nice staff. http://www.teamworkphoto.com
* Camera City, nr British Museum, London: A shop I chanced across, but has a really impressive collection of mainly 35mm film cameras. http://cameracity.co.uk
* London Camera Exchange, Strand, London: Mainly a regular digital reseller with a decent sized 2nd hand film collection. https://www.lcegroup.co.uk
* Sendean Cameras, Clerkenwell, London: A short walk from Farringdon station. Sendean has a very tidy collection of used film cameras, some hard to find examples. They also have what looks like a very active repair team busying away in the shop. http://www.sendeancameras.co.uk

# Those I’ve bought from online

* Ffordes (Scotland): An extensive collection of used (and new) kit. I recently bought a Bronica SQ-A viewfinder, after much searching (for one that wasn’t priced ridiculously). Great service. http://www.ffordes.com/home
* Student Photo Store (Plymouth): Mainly darkroom kit sellers, but do sell a solid collection of the 35mm (Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, etc) and medium format standard bodies. Not a huge collection of separate lens though. I’ve only bought darkroom kit from these guys. Service and prices were very good though. http://www.studentphotostore.co.uk
* Wy Cameras (Leeds): A wonderful and diverse online collection of cameras and lenses. I’ve just bought a Contax ST body (mid Nov 2016) from them, in excellent condition and a very good price. http://wycameras.com

# Those I regular check for kit but haven’t bought from (yet!)

* Dale Photographic (Leeds): http://www.dalephotographic.co.uk
* The Real Camera Company (Manchester): http://www.realcamera.co.uk
* Mifsuds (Devon): http://mifsuds.com

# And finally, those I’ve just found out about!

* Rocky Cameras (Dorset): a pretty big online collection. However, apparently something of a ‘sold as seen’ shop. Some pretty good prices; quality may or may not match. http://www.rockycameras.com
* MW Classic Cameras (London): Seems to cater for high-end classics such as Leica and Hasselblad, on initial inspection. Looking further, there’s some very cheap regular film bodies and lens, as well as some more obscure items. I can’t vouch for quality or service. http://mwclassic.com
* Worldwide Camera Exchange (nr London): Apparently around for a long time. A mix of film and digital. Fairly big collection. http://www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk
* Peter Walnes (Cornwall): Something of a one-man band who’s been trading for a long time. Quite a varied collection on the website. https://secure.peterwalnes.com
* Camtech Photographic (Cambridge): Seem to have a decent used film collection of used gear with condition stated, but no specific images to view. http://www.camtechuk.com/index.php
* Camley Photographic (Hove): Apart from an awful search results list, they have some decent kit (especially some well priced Bronica stuff). Looks like a lot of their selling is done on Ebay as well. http://www.camleyphotographic.com

I would love it if anyone has any others to share.
