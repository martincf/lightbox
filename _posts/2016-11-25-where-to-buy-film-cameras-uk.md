### Last updated 22 June 2018

In light of forever assessing and wanting to add to an unnecessarily growing collection of film cameras and lenses here’s my list of UK camera shops that I’ve either visited, or ordered from, or just keep checking for that desirable rare piece.

## Those I’ve visited in London

All of the below are easy to get to over a couple of hours. Very useful if you’re in the city hunting for a particular item.

* **Aperture, nr Tottenham Court Rd, London:** Totally dedicated to buying, selling, and fixing film cameras. Also has a smaller shop near the British Museum, with a cafe, camera museum, and selling mainly Hasselblad kit. [http://www.apertureuk.com](http://www.apertureuk.com)
* **Mr Cad, nr Victoria Station, London:** Worth the visit if only to speak to Alex, Mr Cad, himself. A wonderfully knowledgeable owner with an amazing collection. [http://www.mrcad.co.uk](http://www.mrcad.co.uk)
* **Camera World, nr Oxford Rd, London:** A small collection, but worth a look. Friendly helpful staff as well. [https://www.cameraworld.co.uk](https://www.cameraworld.co.uk)
* **Teamwork, nr Tottenham Court Rd, London:** mainly high spec large and medium format kit. A shop mainly catering for pro photographers. Nice staff. [http://www.teamworkphoto.com](http://www.teamworkphoto.com)
* **Camera City, nr British Museum, London:** A shop I chanced across, but has a really impressive collection of mainly 35mm film cameras. Priced high though. [http://cameracity.co.uk](http://cameracity.co.uk)
* **London Camera Exchange, Strand, London:** Mainly a regular digital reseller with a decent sized 2nd hand film collection. Their website covers user equipment across the many stores they have across the UK. [https://www.lcegroup.co.uk](https://www.lcegroup.co.uk)
* **Sendean Cameras, Clerkenwell, London:** A short walk from Farringdon station. Sendean has a very tidy collection of used film cameras, some hard to find examples. They also have what looks like a very active repair team busying away in the shop. Priced high too. [http://www.sendeancameras.co.uk](http://www.sendeancameras.co.uk)
* **Red Dot Cameras, Clerkenwell nr Barbican station, London:** I recently bought a very reasonably priced lens from Red Dot. I can't say service was particularly warm though. Visit clued up about what you want, help doesn't seem too forthcoming. [http://www.reddotcameras.co.uk](http://www.reddotcameras.co.uk)
* **The Classic Camera, nr British Museum, London:** Mainly Leica but sell other brands too. Some decent priced bodies that look well chosen. I previously bought a Leica M4-2 and lens from these guys. Service was great, so was the Leica! [http://theclassiccamera.com](http://theclassiccamera.com)

## Those I’ve bought from online
* **Ffordes (Scotland):** An extensive collection of used (and new) kit. If you're struggling to find anything specific, you probably haven't browsed Ffordes's website yet. [http://www.ffordes.com/home](http://www.ffordes.com/home). They also have a Leica-centric website at [http://www.rangefinder.uk.com](http://www.rangefinder.uk.com)
* **Wy Cameras (Leeds):** A wonderful and diverse online collection of cameras and lenses. I’ve bought many things from them, always in excellent condition and a very good price. [http://wycameras.com](http://wycameras.com)
* **Student Photo Store (Plymouth):** Mainly darkroom kit sellers, but do sell a solid collection of the 35mm (Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, etc) and medium format standard bodies. Not a huge collection of separate lens though. I’ve only bought darkroom kit from these guys. Service and prices were very good though. [http://www.studentphotostore.co.uk](http://www.studentphotostore.co.uk)
* **Harrison Cameras (Sheffield):** Another regular camera store selling new gear but with a decent used section online. Some good film bargains crop up from time to time. [http://www.harrisoncameras.co.uk/Used/](http://www.harrisoncameras.co.uk/Used/)
* **Mifsuds (Devon):** I bought a medium format camera from Mifsuds which unfortunately died (electronics). The problem should've been spotted before sending, but they were gracious in how they dealt with the issue. A good range of products but no images! [http://mifsuds.com](http://mifsuds.com)
* **MW Classic Cameras (London):** Caters for classics such as Leica and similar. There’s some very cheap regular film bodies and lens, as well as some more obscure items. Unfortunately, my experience was of a very disorganised company (lost orders, no delivery for months, refusal to respond to emails). [http://mwclassic.com](http://mwclassic.com)
* **Carmarthen Cameras (Wales):** I've bought stuff from Camarthen Cameras via Ebay, but not their website. Always had great service. [https://carmarthencameras.com](https://carmarthencameras.com

# Those I regular check for kit but haven’t bought from (yet!)
* **305C:** A wonderful Instagram presence and a reseller who prides themselves on their knowledge and high quality items. Stuff sells quick so move quick if you want to buy from them. [https://matthewtou.com](https://matthewtou.com)
* **Skears Photographic (Northampton):** [http://www.skearsphoto.com](http://www.skearsphoto.com)
* **Dale Photographic (Leeds):** [http://www.dalephotographic.co.uk](http://www.dalephotographic.co.uk)
* **The Real Camera Company (Manchester):** [http://www.realcamera.co.uk](http://www.realcamera.co.uk)
* **Rocky Cameras (Dorset):** a pretty big online collection. However, apparently something of a ‘sold as seen’ shop. Some pretty good prices; quality may or may not match. [http://www.rockycameras.com](http://www.rockycameras.com)
* **Worldwide Camera Exchange (nr London):** Around for a long time. A mix of film and digital. Fairly big collection. [http://www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk](http://www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk)
* **Peter Walnes (Cornwall):** Something of a one-man band who’s been trading for a long time. Quite a varied collection on the website. [https://secure.peterwalnes.com](https://secure.peterwalnes.com)
* **Camtech Photographic (Cambridge):** Seem to have a decent used film collection of used gear with condition stated, but no specific images to view. [http://www.camtechuk.com/index.php](http://www.camtechuk.com/index.php)
* **Camley Photographic (Hove):** Apart from an awful search results list, they have some decent kit (especially some well priced Bronica stuff). Looks like a lot of their selling is done on Ebay as well. [http://www.camleyphotographic.com](http://www.camleyphotographic.com)
* **The Camera House (West Yorkshire):** An old looking website with a lot of lists of used kit. Some choice stuff by the looks of things. [http://www.the-camera-house.co.uk](http://www.the-camera-house.co.uk)
* **Commercial Cameras (Shropshire):** High spec professional camera sellers with a small but tidy used section on their website (Leicas, Mamiya, Hasselblad, large format, etc.) [http://www.commercialcameras.co.uk](http://www.commercialcameras.co.uk)
* **JK Cameras (London):** Exclusively Leica by the looks of it, and not much of it, but seems to pride themselves on quality. [http://www.jkcameras.co.uk](http://www.jkcameras.co.uk)
* **Peter Loy (London):** An afternoon can be spent just browsing the collection of stock on this website. Lots of rarities. Seems to be mail/tel order only. [http://www.peterloy.com](http://www.peterloy.com)
* **Richard Caplan (Pall Mall, London):** Another mainly Leica, but also Hasselblad and FujiFilm. Another well respected 'red dot' dealer. [http://www.richardcaplan.co.uk](http://www.richardcaplan.co.uk)
* **The Vintage & Classic Camera Co. (Hayling Island, nr Portsmouth):** A large collection of 35mm, medium format, and large format cameras and lenses. [http://vintageclassiccamera.com](http://vintageclassiccamera.com)

I would love it if anyone has any others to share.
