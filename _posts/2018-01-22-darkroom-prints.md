Lightbox is six months into it's life as a darkroom. During that time I've managed to run around fourteen workshops for colour development or black & white development and printing.

Printing is where the real magic happens. Anticipating the appearance of a developing print never gets boring. Watching workshop participants' faces whilst this happens is just great. Over the past six months, there's been some wonderful work printed – even if it was just for a try-out workshop day. During the workshop, we usually try and push the possibilities of the print – change contrast, dodging and burning, split grade printing. This helps future members understand how to manipulate light on the enlarger to achieve more personalised or refined images.

Below is a small selection of some those great prints that have development in the darkroom over the past half a year.
