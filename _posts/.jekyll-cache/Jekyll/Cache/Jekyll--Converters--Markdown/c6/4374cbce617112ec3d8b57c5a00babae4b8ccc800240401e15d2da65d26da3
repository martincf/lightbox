<p>The work stemmed from my own feelings of being more and more coddled into keeping the world and other people at armsâ€™ length. Why do I need to explore when everything is neatly and exhaustively presented to me? How can I explore?</p>

<p>The subject covered is the experience that each screen purports to give to its viewer who sits somewhere far from the event and far in the future. How much is lost?</p>

<p>An informal opening at 6.30pm, Friday 28th September in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A4zKscwVLc52">Ropes &amp; Twines</a> will kick off the exhibition, including a free drink on arrival. All are welcome!</p>
