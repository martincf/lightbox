I"¾<p><strong>There was a grand idea to have the darkroom built by Christmas (2016). Ambition gave way to much needed family downtime during the period, so progress was slow. However, itâ€™s 2017 and weâ€™re forging ahead!</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned on the homepage, we are literally building the darkroom from the ground up. Well, actually from the roof down. We shall a finished roof to work under as of this weekend (28th January). From then on, we have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open up a door way on the side of the permanent building</li>
  <li>lay down a timber floor</li>
  <li>build the internal structure</li>
  <li>run the electricity and water cables and pipes</li>
  <li>fit out the darkroom</li>
  <li>open the doors!</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ve had some promising news of a significant donation possibly coming our way. A stainless steel darkroom wash basin. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Currently, weâ€™re aiming for a slightly optimistic target of having all but fitting the darkroom done by the end of February. Thatâ€™s next month, 2017. Now that the roof is all but on, I intend to tweet more about progress with pictures. So, <a href="https://twitter.com/lightboxdrkroom">follow Lightbox on Twitter</a>.</p>
