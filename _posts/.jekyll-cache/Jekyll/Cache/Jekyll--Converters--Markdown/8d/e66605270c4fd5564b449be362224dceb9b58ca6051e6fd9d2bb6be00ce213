I"{<p><strong>The first process worth learning within the world of the darkroom is the task of developing black and white film. Mostly science (and a dash of luck), there’s nothing more exciting than developing your own roll of film.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-on-the-day">What to expect on the day</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A class of up to three people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);</li>
  <li>lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. You’ll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;</li>
  <li>a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);</li>
  <li>all chemicals, equipment provided;</li>
  <li>a sense of pride at having used science to create art.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h2>

<p>Just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures).
