I"e<p>Starting 19th July 2018, Simon Gabriel exhibits his select archive of 2014-2016 colour photographic imagery. Shot on traditional colour Kodak film, Simon’s work conjures up motion picture-like scenes out of the real world, blending the Americana glamour of LA and San Francisco with the easily overlooked every day world of Liverpool and Birkenhead.</p>
