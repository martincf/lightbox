<p>Iâ€™ll send you a payment link online to pay for the voucher once Iâ€™ve received the above details. The voucher is valid until January 2019 and can be used anytime throughout the year. All the recipient needs to do is get in touch and arrange a date.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-day">About the day</h2>
<p>A darkroom day will be similar to the already established Lightbox Darkroom <a href="/learn/black-and-white-film-development/">film development</a> and <a href="/learn/print-development/">printing workshop</a> except, weâ€™ll also spend an hour or so at the beginning of the day taking photos on our film cameras (around West Kirby, whatever the weather) before we process and print them back at the darkroom.</p>

<p>The days can be arranged for a Saturday, Sunday, or Monday throughout 2018, and there will usually be two attendees.</p>
