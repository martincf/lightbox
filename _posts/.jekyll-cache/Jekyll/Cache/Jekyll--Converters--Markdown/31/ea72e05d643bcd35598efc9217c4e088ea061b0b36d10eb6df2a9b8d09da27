<p><strong>The Somme Project was a ten year photographic and film work. Started in 2006, and ended with the centenary of the Battle of the Somme in 2016.</strong></p>

<p>The Somme Project is about memory, landscape and the sense of absence which dominates the localities which were touched by the Battle of the Somme. The Project attempts to record the journeys made by those who took part in the battle and the subsequent visits made by others since. Attempting to understand what was experienced by those locked in five months of intense fighting is difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>The Project attempts to create a series of metaphors for these complex experiences through the contemporary use of photography, text and sound, alongside a walking of the ‘Somme’ as it exists in the present-day landscape.
