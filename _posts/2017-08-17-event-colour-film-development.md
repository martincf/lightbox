**The process of developing colour film can be a daunting prospect, but is actually fairly straightforward with the right guidance and equipment. Join our workshop to find out how to develop your own C41 (colour) film.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. You'll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);
- all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided; and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a finished roll of colour 35mm or medium format film. You can buy film locally from the [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) or [Wilkinsons Cameras](http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/) in Liverpool, or buy it [online here](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html). If you want very standard and cheap colour film, visit a local Poundland and purchase £1 rolls of Agfa Vista 200!

## Schedule for the day

* Introduction to the standardised C41 colour development process
