**Probably the easiest process within the world of film photography is the task of developing black and white film. Part science, part art (and a dash of luck), there's nothing more exciting than developing your own roll of film.**

At the end of the day you will have access to a scanner to scan a high resolution version of your images. (Alternatively, you'll be able to hand print them in the darkroom in a few weeks time!)

What you will need: just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures). You can buy black and white 35mm film locally from the Open Eye Gallery or Wilkinsons Cameras in Liverpool, or [buy film online](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html). If you're really desperate, email me and I can sell a small amount from my own collection.

What will be supplied on the day: all that you need to successfully develop your film by hand! Chemicals, equipment, film holder sheets, and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll*

Schedule for the day:

* 13:00pm: greetings, house rules, and the basics of developing film
* 13.45pm: Calculating your chemicals
* 14:00pm: Film development
* 15:00pm: Break for refreshments
* 15:30pm: Storing your film and scanning
* 17:30pm: Fin

*Due to the length of time it takes to scan film, we limit access to the scanner to 5 scans per person on the day. If time allows, you can scan more.
