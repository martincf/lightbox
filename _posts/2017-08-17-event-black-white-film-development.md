**The first process worth learning within the world of the darkroom is the task of developing black and white film. Mostly science (and a dash of luck), there's nothing more exciting than developing your own roll of film.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to three people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. You'll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);
- all chemicals, equipment provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures). You can buy black and white 35mm film locally from the [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) or [Wilkinsons Cameras](http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/) in Liverpool, or buy it [online here](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html).
