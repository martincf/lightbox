**Lith printing is a specialised darkroom printing technique that results in beautiful high contrast, grainy, impressionable print. The technique is synonymous with a rough and ready hand-printed effect.**

To kick off his exhibition at [Lightbox Gallery](http://localhost:4000/gallery/mark-elmore-gallery-exhibition), [Elmore](http://www.elmorephotos.com) will be running a day of workshops on Sunday, 30th September.

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, ideally you will have had some darkroom experience beforehand;
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all chemicals, equipment and standard paper will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing; a fully developed roll of 35mm or medium format black and white film ready to print from.

## Schedule for the day

* Meet at West Kirby Arts Centre: greetings, house rules
* The basics of lith printing
* Lith printing
* Final thoughts (whilst your prints dry)
* Fin

## Cost

£35 for non-Lightbox Darkroom members, £25 for members.

*Attendees must be over 16 years of age.
