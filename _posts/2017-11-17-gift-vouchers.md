**It's close to Christmas so, I've decided to get some vouchers printed if you'd like to gift a day's workshop shooting, developing, and printing film photography to a friend or family member.**

## How to buy a voucher
There's a limited number of vouchers so be quick! They cost Â£40 each and can either be picked up at the darkroom in the West Kirby Arts Centre, or posted out to you. Simply click the button below and make sure you send me the following information:

* Your name (and postal address if you want me to mail it)
* Voucher recipient name
* Voucher recipient email and telephone number

All vouchers are A6 in size and come in a blank white envelope.

  <button class="cta--button">
    <a href="mailto:info@lightbox.photo?subject=Gift%20voucher">Request a voucher</a>
  </button>
</p>


I'll send you a payment link online to pay for the voucher once I've received the above details. The voucher is valid until January 2019 and can be used anytime throughout the year. All the recipient needs to do is get in touch and arrange a date.

## About the day
A darkroom day will be similar to the already established Lightbox Darkroom [film development](/learn/black-and-white-film-development/) and [printing workshop](/learn/print-development/) except, we'll also spend an hour or so at the beginning of the day taking photos on our film cameras (around West Kirby, whatever the weather) before we process and print them back at the darkroom.

The days can be arranged for a Saturday, Sunday, or Monday throughout 2018, and there will usually be two attendees.
