### What's it like to be sixteen years old in the UK now?


**For this major touring project leading contemporary photographers joined forces with more than one hundred and seventy young people from diverse communities across the country to discuss their hopes and fears, and who or what inspires them. Using video, photography, writing, audio recordings, and social media this collaboration gives prominence to voices rarely heard. **

Photographer Craig Easton conceived the project at the time of the Scottish independence referendum when sixteen year olds were given the vote for the first, and so far, only time. Later he invited fellow photographers to join him and develop it across the UK.  

Ropes & Twines presents a specially selected sequence of work from the larger SIXTEEN portfolio. Sophie Gerrard’s quiet images of young people who share her love of the land in Scotland act as  counterpoint to Craig Easton’s powerful, black and white series made in towns across the north of England. Alongside these are single, incisive photographs by Christopher Nunn and Michelle Snk who engaged with young people in Yorkshire and Hampshire.  

Further SIXTEEN work is showcased in partnership with [ The Atkinson](https://www.theatkinson.co.uk) in Southport and [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) and [Tate Exchange](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool/tate-exchange) in Liverpool.
