**Spend a weekend learning how to use a film camera and how to develop & print your photographs in Lightbox Darkroom.**

Are you just starting out with film photography? Come and join Lightbox Darkroom for a weekend of learning! We'll spend a Saturday together learning how to use film cameras and developing your roll of film. Sunday will be spent printing your images.

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- A light wander around West Kirby (typically the marine lake) to shoot our rolls of film together
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- lunch provided at a local café
- all film, chemicals, equipment and standard paper will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Ideally, your own film camera (35mm or medium format is fine), and a coat for the photography morning walkabout. If you don't have a film camera, one can be supplied on the day.
