Starting 19th July 2018, Simon Gabriel exhibits his select archive of 2014-2016 colour photographic imagery. Shot on traditional colour Kodak film, Simon's work conjures up motion picture=like scenes out of the real world, blending the Americana glamour of LA and San Francisco with the easily overlooked every day world  f Liverpool and Birkenhead.
