**Learn how to print from your own  black and white film photography images. The satisfaction and aesthetic beauty of a silver gelatin print cannot be beaten. Come and learn how to create some wonderful imagery, and finish the day with your own prints to frame.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all chemicals and paper will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.
