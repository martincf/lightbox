**Learn how to process black & white film and print in the darkroom with photographer and darkroom expert, Les Meehan.**

A workshop designed to help new darkroom users learn the basics of black & white film processing and printing

This day-long workshop will teach you how to:
1. process a previously exposed film;
1. make a contact/proof print;
1. make a correctly exposed and contrast adjusted print;
1. make simple local tonal adjustments (basic dodging/burning);
