## From 19th September to 23rd October 2019

Six By Six's mission is to start conversations, spark debate and grow a network of people interested in photography. Our home is a venue that is not a traditional gallery; it's a place where we ill stimulate informal discussions and display work. Lightbox Gallery at Ropes & Twines has a history of supporting photography. Is relaxed atmosphere will provide the ideal space to debate notions of contemporary photography. 

Six By Six is a group of established documentary photographers: [Craig Easton](https://www.craigeaston.com), [Colin McPherson](http://www.colinmcpherson.com), [Stephen McCoy](http://mccoywynne.co.uk), [Stephanie Wynne](http://mccoywynne.co.uk), [Tadhg Devlin](https://www.tadhgdevlin.com), and [Adam Lee](http://www.adamleephotography.com/Home.html).

Join us on Thursday 19th September at [Lightbox Gallery](https://lightbox.photo/gallery/), [Ropes & Twines](http://www.ropes-and-twines.co.uk), Liverpool.

The evening will kick off with short introductions to the work of the Six By Six photographers. This will be followed by a talk by Tadhg Devlin on the photography of Zoe Strauss and the evening will be rounded off with an open panel discussion of trends and ideas in contemporary photography chaired by Martin Chapman Fromm of the Lightbox Darkroom and Gallery.

The event is free. All welcome. We look forward to seeing you on the 19th September.
