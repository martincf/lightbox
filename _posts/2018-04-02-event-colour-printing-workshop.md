**Colours from traditional film are magical. At Lightbox Darkroom, you can now learn how to print from your colour negatives the traditional way!**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- Lights on most of the time. Only when paper is exposed on the enlarger is complete darkness required (a minute or two at a time);
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all chemicals, equipment, paper will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a developed roll of colour 35mm or medium format film. You can buy film locally from the [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) or [Wilkinsons Cameras](http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/) in Liverpool, or buy it [online here](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html).

You can develop your film at a [Max Spielmann](https://www.maxphoto.co.uk) or similar processors. Alternatively, you can book yourself onto one of Lightbox's [colour film development workshops](/learn/colour-film-development) beforehand.
