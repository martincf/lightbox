**Coming soon to Liverpool, Lightbox Gallery will be a place to showcase new or as yet unseen bodies of photographic work exclusively developed using traditional film and darkroom techniques.**

Located on one of Liverpool's hippest and busiest high streets (full location to be revealed soon), the gallery will run a year-round programme of exhibits and occasional talks and workshops.

The gallery has been created by a group of creatives who have a love for photography and particularly film photography. We hope to build a community around this passion and engage with those who are purveyors, masters, or fresh to the practice of this visual form.

## Long term aims of the gallery

The gallery is looking to create a network of project-based photographers, artists, and creators who value traditional film and darkroom processes. It will bring new, exciting and provocative work to a wide audience and be some part of the revival of traditional photographic practices.

## Submissions

Lightbox is actively seeking submissions for bodies of photographic work to exhibit in 2018 and 2019. Whilst we're still in the planning phase of getting things up and running, it'd be great to start a conversation with anyone who has an interesting project completed or currently in progress.

### Some things to think about when submitting ideas

- Work should be thematic/story-led – accompanied with a summary piece outlining the work (background, project goals, etc.)
- The space will have 10-14 permanently fixed frames available for prints up to 28"x28"
- Since Lightbox runs a darkroom, we have the facilities to print your work for the exhibit – this could form part of our collaboration together
- Exhibits will likely last around 6 weeks

Over the next few weeks we'll update this website to reflect more details and progress. If you think you've got something worth working together on then [email us](mailto:info@lightbox.photo) and we'll get talking.
