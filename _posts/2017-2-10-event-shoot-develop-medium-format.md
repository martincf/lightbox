**Medium format film (known as 120 film) is typically associated with genres such as fashion and advertising photography.**

 The quality of medium format far exceeds 35mm film, and is still higher quality than most modern professional digital cameras. Cameras for medium format have been around for over a century. This means that you can pick up a medium format camera at a decent price (typically around £150-£300 for anything decent).

* Shoot and develop with a medium format camera and film.
* Bring your own medium format camera or use one of our's.
* What you need to bring: Only a medium format camera, if you have one. Otherwise, just bring yourself. We'll supply the film.
