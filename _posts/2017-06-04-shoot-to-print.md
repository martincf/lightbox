**Learn how to shoot, develop and then print your own film photography images. The satisfaction and aesthetic beauty of a silver halide print cannot be beaten. Come and learn how to create some wonderful imagery, and finish the day with your own prints to frame and/or sell.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to three people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);
- all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided; and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll*;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a working 35mm film camera. I'll provide black and white film on the day (usually Ilford HP5+ or Ilford FP4+).

## Schedule for the day

* Meet at The Arts Centre: greetings, house rules, and decide where we'll shoot (beach, hills, or indoors)
