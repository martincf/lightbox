**Six months building followed by six months of darkrooming. January marks a year of Lightbox. Here's some ideas planned (or not yet planned) for 2018.**

## More annual members, but only a few more
Once the darkroom opened its doors in June 2017, I planned to have five annual members by December. Lightbox now has seven, soon to be ten by the end of January. I think there's capacity for twelve; fifteen at a stretch. Any more and fair access to the darkroom could not be promised to all members.

For Â£10 per month, members get unrestricted access to Lightbox, chemicals included. As long as time is free in the calendar, a member can book themselves in.

I'd like to encourage the membership to print and develop their work through some of the next few ideas...

## Interesting workshops
Workshops for black & white film development and printing, and colour film development, are booking up well in advance. So much so that on occasions I have to fit ad hoc workshops in.

This year, I plan to run colour printing workshops and workshops for those who have some darkroom skills already. Mainly, how to print on fibre paper, and mounting and framing artwork. I hope these types of workshops would encourage members to participate in...

## Exhibitions and talks
Since Lightbox is attached to the side of a local arts centre, it'd be silly not to hold exhibitions in the space. And that's precisely what's planned. Likely to happen around May/June time, I'd love to see some of the work printed in the darkroom by members, on show in a gallery space.

I would also love to run a series of talks based around traditional photography. There's a few artists and photographers I have in mind already, as always I just need to organise it all!

## Publishing
This is the biggy for me personally. I trained as graphic designer and intended to become a book designer back in my student days. There was a new thing called the internet at the time, I was in London surrounded by businesses with money (more of it than sense based on some of the projects we were offered), and the rest is history.

I never set Lightbox up to be a publishing house, but there's certainly an opportunity to publish work that has been through the darkroom or is based on traditional techniques. Printing costs are now so ridiculously cheap compared to twenty years ago, it'd be dumb not to give a try.

The first publication will be a Lightbox yearbook. A selection of work from workshop attendees and members will grace the pages of a short run. In what exact form is yet to be determined but I'll treat it as a trial run for future projects.

## And a few surprises
Every person who has attended a workshop or is now a member has been a delight to work with. Some of those I have got to know well. Some interesting  opportunities over the past few months have arisen from our discussions. Watch this space!
