**Learn how to traditional shoot studio portraiture using your film camera – from a professional**

## First date announced: Saturday 13th June 2020

[Request a place, £95 per person](mailto:info@lightbox.photo?subject=Booking%20request%20-%20{{ page.title }})

This year (2020) sees the introduction of the traditional film studio portrait workshop. A workshop designed to teach attendees how to setup lighting for portraiture and correctly expose for film (35mm or medium format on the day).

This day-long workshop will teach you how to:
1. get to grips with lighting portraits in context with film photography;
1. create lighting setups for a variety of looks;
1. control both the light quality and the lighting contrast;
1. pose the subject for the desired result;
1. create multi-light setups.


## Who should attend this workshop?
Anyone with basic camera skills. No darkroom skills are required for this workshop. However, when you'd like to take things further and learn how to develop and/or print your own work you can [browse our list of basic workshops](/learn).

## What to expect on the day
- a class of up to twelve people – in groups of two or three;
- a relaxed atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all lighting will be supplied (but you're welcome to also bring your own)
- tea and coffee will be available, lunch will not be provided (there's plenty of shops and cafés in central West Kirby, nearby)

## What you will need

- Your own film camera.
- Although this is a traditional film-based workshop, we do think a digital SLR camera is useful for pre-visualising your lighting setup before shooting your film, but not essential.
- You will also need to bring as much film as you think may be necessary. Colour or black and white is fine.
- A tripod (a few spare tripods will be available on the day, if you can't bring your own)
