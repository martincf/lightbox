## About Parallax Photographic Coop
Parallax Photographic, as a company at least, are the new kids on the block. Their business is designed to cater for a new generation of film shooters and printers. Parallax are integral to the regrowth of film photography in the UK. In fact, they’ve written some [great articles about developing film](https://parallaxphotographic.coop/photographic-resources/) which are well worth reading if you’re coming to a Lightbox workshop.

Having met some of the gang, and placed a few orders with them, I can say they’re nothing short of a great bunch to deal with and very efficient. So, if you’re looking to shoot some film before coming to the darkroom, [just give me a shout](mailto:info@lightbox.photo?subject=Parallax%20Discount).
