**12 August until mid-September 2018**

This August, Lightbox Darkroom has been running for one whole year  at West Kirby Arts Centre. Displayed will be a selection of the darkroom members' black and white prints developed during this time.

The silver gelatin prints on show were shot on film and printed by hand  using traditional photographic darkroom processes.

## Purchasing prints

The work displayed is for sale and a further limited number of editions of each print can also be produced. Because printing by hand is much slower than modern digital techniques, each print takes time to complete. Every print will have slight variations in contrast or tone, making every edition unique.

By purchasing one of these print editions, you will be investing in Lightbox Darkroom; a local commuinity darkroom created to reintroduce traditional photography to a new generation of artists.

- Large prints £50 mounted & unframed; £100 mounted & framed
- Smaller prints £25 mounted & unframed; £40 mounted & framed

Prints exhibited have been created by Martin Chapman Fromm, Maeyls Coutart, Steven Starr, Tom Clarke, and Felipe Chapman Fromm.
