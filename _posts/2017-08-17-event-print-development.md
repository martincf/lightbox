**Learn how to print your own film photography images. The satisfaction and aesthetic beauty of a silver gelatin print cannot be beaten. Come and learn how to create some wonderful imagery, and finish the day with your own prints to frame and/or sell.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to two people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- In the darkroom, lights are on all of the time! No complete darkness required (our red darkroom safelights make it easy to see at all times).
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected;
- all chemicals, equipment and standard paper will be provided;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing; a fully developed roll of 35mm or medium format black and white film.

## Schedule for the day

* Meet at West Kirby Arts Centre: greetings, house rules
* The basics of printing
* Advanced printing (dodging and burning, split grade printing)
* Final thoughts (whilst your prints dry)
* Fin

*Attendees must be over 16 years of age.
