## From 27th June to 31st July 2019

**As a photographer with an extensive body of work spanning the last three decades, surprisingly, this is Nick's first exhibition.**


After graduating from the revered School of Documentary Photography in Newport during the 1990s, Nick set off to the USA on a road trip. A trip that lasted years, living out of a car and off the kindness of the locals; those who were living beyond the American dream.

The exhibition will display 18 images from Nick's time travelling around the backwaters of America. This will be just the beginning of his work being displayed and published – work that spans decades of documentary imagery, of which Beyond the American Dream is but a small part.

You can follow Nick on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nicholasthomaswynne/). The exhibition opening will be at [Ropes & Twines](https://goo.gl/maps/DYQZoAT73dT2gHgx8) 6.30pm, Thursday 27th June 2019.
