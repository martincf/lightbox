**Step up and further your darkroom printing knowledge with photographer and darkroom expert, Les Meehan.**

This year (2020) sees the introduction of the intermediate level darkroom printing workshop. A workshop designed to help darkroom users to print with a greater level of control and efficiency, to professional standards.

This day-long workshop will teach you how to:
1. make ‘one-exposure’ proof sheets;
1. use the f/Stop printing method;
1. use two different split-grade printing methods;
1. use print ‘flashing’ for high tone value control;
1. create a dodging/burning ‘plan’;
1. make local tone and contrast adjustments (dodging/burning);
1. make and use shaped dodging/burning masks.

## Who should attend this workshop?
Anyone with the basic darkroom skills i.e. capable of making a normal black & white print on resin-coated multigrade paper. If you need to learn the basics of darkroom printing first, please [browse our list of basic workshops](/learn).

>  I’ve been developing and printing my own black and white material for over 40 years and always wondered why my prints were not anywhere near the standard of some of the great stuff I’d seen in books and magazines. Having been on the intermediate printing course I can now see exactly what I was doing wrong and Les has given me a set of techniques and a level of understanding to enable me to make consistently high quality prints without huge amounts of trial and (mostly) error. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and Les’s teaching style and can heartily recommend it.
