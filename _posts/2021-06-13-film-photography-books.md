There are photographers and darkroom practitioners who literally wrote the book about film photography and darkroom techniques. Being a darkroom, we're lucky enough to have acquired quite a few them over the years. Many, in fact most of them, are more or less as valid as the year they were published. Below are a list of those I have either in the darkroom or personally. Fair warning, I have yet to fully complete any of these books from start to finish, using them as reference material in the main.

If you intend to invest in any of the books below, doing so from the Amazon link would be greatly appreciated as it will help a little with funding the darkroom, thanks!
