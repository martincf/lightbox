excerpt: In the interest of fine tuning Lightbox, I'm looking for experience film photographers to run it through its paces in July.

**Now that Lightbox Darkroom is finished, I'd love to get some peer feedback over the next couple of weeks.**

So, if you're a professional photographer *with darkroom experience*, I'm offering a free 4 hour session. All I ask in return is feedback and for you to spread the word about Lightbox!

## How to book, and when

You can book your 4 hour slot from 3 July until 9 July 2017. The darkroom will be open Mon-Sun, 9.30am-9.30pm (if you'd like to start earlier, let me know.) I'll briefly introduce you to the equipment and building before you get to use the space.

[To book, email me](mailto:info@lightbox.photo) your preferred date and time and I'll get right back to you. On the day, please bring proof of address and photo ID. This is an insurance requirement only. Your details won't be passed on to any third parties.

## Chemicals and paper for the session

Standard black and white Ilford chemicals for development and printing (usually stock ID11 and Multigrade) will be supplied, you'll have to bring your own paper though. Concerning colour, I'm happy to supply a small amount of C41 development chemicals for use with the Jobo CPE2 machine. If you'd like to try colour printing, let me know in advance and I'll obtain some RA4 print chemicals.

## Equipment and capabilities

* 2 x 35mm/medium format enlargers: De Vere 203 with black and white Ilford Multigrade head & Durst M605 colour
* Jobo CPE2 rotary machine (for colour development and printing)
* Nova upright print processor (16 x 12 inches)
* Wet sink for 24 x 20 inch flat tray print development

The darkroom is currently not capable of printing large format, but I do plan to upgrade in the future. You are of course welcome to develop your large format film.
