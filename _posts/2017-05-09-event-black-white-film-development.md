**The easiest process within the world of darkroom processing is the task of developing black and white film. Mostly science with a touch of art (and a dash of luck), there's nothing more exciting than developing your own roll of film.**

## What to expect on the day
- A class of up to four people only, of any skill level (from absolute beginners to those refreshing their memory);
- lights are on all of the time! No darkroom darkness required. You'll use a dark bag to load your film into a light-tight canister;
- a relaxed, fun atmosphere where making mistakes is expected (I still ruin the odd roll of film from time to time);
- all chemicals, equipment, film sleeves will be provided; and access to a computer and scanner to scan your favourite shots from your roll*;
- a sense of pride at having used science to create art.

## What you will need

Just one thing, a finished roll of black and white 35mm film (24 or 36 exposures). You can buy black and white 35mm film locally from the [Open Eye Gallery](https://openeye.org.uk) or [Wilkinsons Cameras](http://www.wilkinson.co.uk/w/storelocation/liverpool/) in Liverpool, or buy it [online here](/posts/where-to-buy-film-uk.html). If you're really desperate, email me and I can sell a small amount from my own collection.

## Schedule for the day

* Greetings, house rules, and the basics of developing film
* Calculating your chemicals
* Loading your film
* Develop your film
* Break for refreshments (whilst your film dries)
* Assessing, storing your film and scanning (due to the length of time it takes to scan film, we'll limit access to the scanner to 5 scans per person on the day. If time allows, you can scan more.)
* Fin


*Attendees must be over 16 years of age.
