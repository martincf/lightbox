**Lightbox Gallery showcases photographic work exclusively developed using traditional film and darkroom techniques.**

Located at [Ropes & Twines, Bold Street](https://goo.gl/maps/Q6SePdeYNH42), one of Liverpool's hippest and busiest high streets, the gallery runs a year-round programme of exhibitions.

The gallery has been created by a group of creatives who have a love for traditional photography. We hope to build a community around this passion and engage with those who are purveyors, masters, or fresh to the practice of this visual form.

## Long term aims of the gallery

The gallery is looking to create a network of project-based photographers, artists, and creators who value traditional film and darkroom processes. It will bring new and old work to a wide audience and be part of the revival of traditional photographic practices.

<h2 class="highlight-title" id="submission_header">Gallery submissions</h2>

<p>Lightbox is actively seeking submissions for bodies of photographic work to exhibit in 2019. It'd be great to start a conversation with anyone who has an interesting project completed or currently in progress.</p>

<h3>We're looking for:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>bodies of work which are documentary and/or have a strong narrative thread – work should be story-led, accompanied with a summary text (background, project goals, etc.);</li>
  <li>at least 18 images for display - the space will have 18 frames available for prints up to 26"x26" and an area for smaller framed pieces;</li>
  <li>available for at least 6 weeks. Exhibits will likely last around 6-8 weeks.</li>
  <li>All work must be film-based. However, digital prints are fine from scans. (If you're printing black and white film digitally, you should really be printing in Lightbox's darkroom!) Since Lightbox runs a darkroom, we have the facilities to print your work for the exhibit – this could form part of our collaboration together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>We're NOT looking for:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>typical trends in film-based photography, without good reason (for example, multiple-exposure cross-processed expired film shots with light leaks because 'film is not dead'!);</li>
  <li>similarly, a lack of narrative and a synopsis as to the reason behind the work – we really are looking to some meaning other than it looks nice or 'I'm a street photographer, innit';</li>
  <li>only a few image submission (see above).</li>

</ul>

<p>If you think you've got something worth working together on then <a href="mailto:info@lightbox.photo">send an email</a> and we'll get talking.</p>
