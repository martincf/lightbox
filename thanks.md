**You've made a booking... thank you!**

## What next?

If you've booked on to a  workshop, you'll receive a reminder of your booking a couple of weeks before the event. Remember, if this your first time, please bring proof of your address (a recent tility bill), and photo identity (driver's license or passport).

In the meantime, [have read of the blog](/blog/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can [send an email](mailto:info@lightbox.photo).
