**Hey, You've made a booking... thanks!**

## What next?

If you've booked on to a regular workshop, I'll send you a reminder of your booking a few days before the event. Remember, if this your first time, please bring proof of your address, and photo ID.

If you've just ordered a gift voucher, I'll email you with details of either how to pick it up, or, when I've posted it to your address.

In the meantime, [have read of the blog](/blog/).
