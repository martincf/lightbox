**Newly established and located in the [West Kirby Arts Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/vzU4Jmw8bYu), Wirral, Lightbox darkroom is a private film photography darkroom that will, over the next few months and year,  evolve into an open darkroom available for hire and for learning.**

## Why open a darkroom?
Film photography is experiencing something of a resurgence. A generation who have never experienced film are discovering the creative potential of developing and printing.

I\'m opening the darkroom to initially satisfy my own creative endeavours. In the future, I hope to help others fuel their own creative output through film photography.


## Who\'s doing this?
I, Martin Chapman Fromm, am originally a graphic designer (London College of Printing being my alma mater). Having been a creative director for many years, I now run the successful digital agency, [Error](http://www.error.agency). I have, admittedly in my spare time, decide to do something with a passion of mine, photography, and specifically film photography, and create Lightbox.

## What\'s the plan?
Currently being built literally from the ground up, Lightbox will run privately for a few months from early 2017 whilst it\'s bedded in and issues ironed. In Spring, I plan to open the darkroom for wider use.

Lightbox plans to provide a darkroom service and learning environment to those who want to explore film photography beyond the camera. A longer term aim is for Lightbox to meaningfully contribute to the world of photography and art.

<!-- ## A call for help, physical and mental
In terms of what the plan for an open darkroom is, there's only a very loose one. I've a broad idea of costs and open times, but I would love to start discussions with anyone interested in using the facility about how they think they'd use it, how much they'd be willing to pay, and any other opportunities that may present themselves.

And whilst I have a lot of fantastic equipment to start with (see below), I would love it if anyone can contribute their old darkroom kit that's going unused (tanks, reels, trays, etc.) -->

## Learning
A medium term goal will be to offer darkroom film development and print workshops. It can be daunting doing this stuff without help and guidance. Whilst I don\'t profess to being an expert (yet!) I am very capable at film development, and competent at printing. Get in touch below if you\'d like to register interested.

## Darkroom capabilities and equipment
The darkroom will be capable of developing and printing black & white and colour 35mm and medium format photographs (up to 6 x 9). Equipment includes:

* two enlargers;
* a rotary (colour) film developing tank;
* upright print tanks, and;
* the usual darkroom paraphernalia (developing tanks, trays, large wash sink).

I will also provide scanning facilities. Gotta get these photos on Flickr, Instagram and Facebook for the likez and favs!
