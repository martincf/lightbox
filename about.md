**Newly established and located in the [West Kirby Arts Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/vzU4Jmw8bYu), Wirral, Lightbox darkroom is an open film photography darkroom available for hire and for learning.**

## Why open a darkroom?
Film photography is experiencing something of a resurgence. A generation who have never experienced film are discovering the creative potential of developing and printing.

I\'m opening the darkroom to satisfy my own creative endeavours and to help others fuel their own creative output through film photography.

## Who\'s doing this?
My name is Martin Chapman Fromm, a designer (London College of Printing being my alma mater). Having been a creative director for many years, I now run the successful digital agency, [Error](http://www.error.agency). I have decide to do something with a passion of mine, photography, and specifically film photography, and create Lightbox.

## What\'s the plan?
The darkroom has literally been built from the ground up. Lightbox is running privately for the month of Jine whilst it\'s bedded in and issues ironed out. From July 2017, the plan is to open [the darkroom](/darkroom-hire) for wider use.

Lightbox provides a darkroom service and learning environment to those who want to explore film photography beyond the camera. A longer term aim is for Lightbox to meaningfully contribute to the world of photography and art.


<!-- ## A call for help, physical and mental
In terms of what the plan for an open darkroom is, there's only a very loose one. I've a broad idea of costs and open times, but I would love to start discussions with anyone interested in using the facility about how they think they'd use it, how much they'd be willing to pay, and any other opportunities that may present themselves.

And whilst I have a lot of fantastic equipment to start with (see below), I would love it if anyone can contribute their old darkroom kit that's going unused (tanks, reels, trays, etc.) -->

## Learning
There are darkroom film development and print [workshops](/learn). Soon, Lightbox will offer even more interesting workshops such as medium and large format photography, development, and printing; and the occasional guest expert workshop for portrait photography on film.

Get in touch below if you\'d like to get involved.

<!-- ## Darkroom capabilities and equipment
The darkroom will be capable of developing and printing black & white and colour 35mm and medium format photographs (up to 6 x 9). The plan is to upgrade 5 x 4 large format printing as soon as is financially viable. Current equipment includes:

* two enlargers: Durst M605 Color and a De Vere 203;
* a sink large enough to print 24 x 20 prints;
* a Jobo rotary (colour) film and print developer;
* Nova upright print tanks, and;
* the usual darkroom paraphernalia (developing tanks, trays, wash sink).

I will also provide scanning facilities. Gotta get these photos on Flickr, Instagram and Facebook for the likez and favs! -->
