<h2 class="highlight-title" id="firsttimebooking">First-time bookings</h2>
<p>First-time bookers will be required to complete a darkroom induction prior to using the darkroom by themselves.</p>

<h3>Professional photographer induction</h3>
<p>If you are a professional photographer, there are no restrictions to hiring the darkroom and the induction will simply cover room and building safety and familiarisation, lasting approximately 45 mins. We can do this before you start using the darkroom for the first time. <strong>There will be a £25 charge for the induction.</strong></p>

<p>If you are a professional photographer who has never used darkroom equipment before, or need a refresher, we strongly advise that you take a longer <a href="/learn/">film development and print workshops</a> first.</p>

<h3>Amateur photographer</h3>
<p>If you are an amateur photographer, you will have to take the <a href="/learn/">darkroom film and print development workshops</a> before hiring the room. This is both a requirement for insurance purposes, and is also the safest way of ensuring you optimise your time in the darkroom as safely as possible.</p>

<h3>Induction day requirements</h3>
<p>On the day of your workshop or first use of the darkroom, we will need you to provide proof of address (a recent utility bill will do) and ID (driving license or passport) on arrival. Both requirements are to satisfy our insurers.</p>
