Lightbox darkroom is available to hire to develop and print your own images. Open 7 days a week, between 10am and 9.30pm*, you can book the darkroom out for a block of 4 hours per session.

## First-time bookings

### Professional photographer
If you are a professional photographer, there are no restrictions to hiring the darkroom. When booking for the first time, all we ask you to provide is proof of address (a recent utility bill will do) and ID (driving license or passport) on arrival. If you are a professional photographer who has never used darkroom equipment before, or need a refresher, we strongly advise that you take the [darkroom induction](#induction) first.

### Amateur photographer
If you are an amateur photographer, you will have to take a [darkroom induction](#induction) before hiring the room. This is both a requirement for insurance purposes, and is also the safest way of ensuring you optimise your time in the darkroom as safely as possible.
