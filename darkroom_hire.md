## Membership

To use the darkroom you will need to pay for a monthly membership. You can pay for a single month, at £15. Or, if you commit to 12 months membership, it's £10 per month (effectively giving you 3 months for free!)

Both memberships will allow you to use the darkroom for four sessions per months. Each session is four hours long; see the table below for availability.

<h2 class="highlight-title" id="firsttimebooking">First-time bookings</h2>
<p>First-time bookers will be required to complete a darkroom induction prior to using the darkroom by themselves. We will also need you to provide proof of address (a recent utility bill will do) and ID (driving license or passport) on arrival. Both requirements are to satisfy our insurers.</p>

<h3>Professional photographer induction</h3>
<p>If you are a professional photographer, there are no restrictions to hiring the darkroom and the induction will simply cover room and building safety and familiarisation, lasting approximately 15 mins. We can do this before you start using the darkroom for the first time. There will be no extra charge for the familiarisation.</p>

<p>If you are a professional photographer who has never used darkroom equipment before, or need a refresher, we strongly advise that you take a longer <a href="#induction">darkroom induction workshop</a> first.</p>

<h3>Amateur photographer</h3>
<p>If you are an amateur photographer, you will have to take a <a href="#induction">darkroom induction workshop</a> before hiring the room. This is both a requirement for insurance purposes, and is also the safest way of ensuring you optimise your time in the darkroom as safely as possible.</p>

  <h1 class="highlight-title">Darkroom induction</h1>
  <p>If you are paying for a monthly or annual membership to the darkroom and need an induction, we can arrange a convenient time depending on darkroom and personal availability.

  An induction costs £15 (plus the cost of the darkroom membership) and will last approximately 2 hours. Each induction can accommodate a maximum of three attendees.</p>

  <p>During the induction we'll cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>darkroom and building safety procedures;</li>
    <li>how to use chemicals to develop film;</li>
    <li>how to use the enlargers;</li>
    <li>how to use chemicals to print a photograph.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All you need to bring for the session is a roll of black and white film to develop and print from; your ID, proof of address (a recent household bill), and payment.</p>

  <h2>Booking an induction</h2>
  To arrange an induction (or to attend an already schedule induction), please <a href="mailto:info@lightbox.photo">email me</a> and I'll get back to you to organise your visit.

## Darkroom capabilities and equipment
The darkroom will be capable of developing and printing black & white and colour 35mm and medium format photographs (up to 6 x 9). We plan to upgrade to a 5 x 4 large format enlarger as soon as is financially viable. Current equipment includes:

* two enlargers: Durst M605 Color and a De Vere 203 with Ilford Multigrade head (both capable of 35mm - medium format);
* trays for 20 x 16 print size;
* a Jobo rotary (colour) film and print developer (can process up to 4 x 35mm films in one go);
* Nova upright print tanks, and;
* the usual darkroom paraphernalia (developing tanks, trays, wash sink).

Scanning facilities will also be provided. Gotta get these photos on Flickr, Instagram and Facebook for the likez and favs!
