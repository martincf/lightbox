<h2 class="highlight-title">First-time bookings</h2>
<p>First-time bookers will be required to complete a darkroom induction prior to using the darkroom by themselves. We will also need you to provide proof of address (a recent utility bill will do) and ID (driving license or passport) on arrival. Both requirements are to satisfy our insurers.</p>

<h3>Professional photographer induction</h3>
<p>If you are a professional photographer, there are no restrictions to hiring the darkroom and the induction will simply cover room and building safety and familiarisation, lasting approximately 15 mins. We can do this before you start using the darkroom for the first time.</p>

<p>If you are a professional photographer who has never used darkroom equipment before, or need a refresher, we strongly advise that you take a longer <a href="#induction">darkroom induction workshop</a> first.</p>

<h3>Amateur photographer</h3>
<p>If you are an amateur photographer, you will have to take a <a href="#induction">darkroom induction workshop</a> before hiring the room. This is both a requirement for insurance purposes, and is also the safest way of ensuring you optimise your time in the darkroom as safely as possible.</p> -->

## Darkroom capabilities and equipment
The darkroom will be capable of developing and printing black & white and colour 35mm and medium format photographs (up to 6 x 9). We plan to upgrade to a 5 x 4 large format enlarger as soon as is financially viable. Current equipment includes:

* two enlargers: Durst M605 Color and a De Vere 203 with Ilford Multigrade head (both capable of 35mm - medium format);
* a sink large enough to print 24 x 20 prints;
* a Jobo rotary (colour) film and print developer (can process up to 4 x 35mm films in one go);
* Nova upright print tanks, and;
* the usual darkroom paraphernalia (developing tanks, trays, wash sink).

Scanning facilities will also be provided. Gotta get these photos on Flickr, Instagram and Facebook for the likez and favs!
