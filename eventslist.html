  <h2>Darkroom workshops and the Coronavirus pandemic</h2>

  <h3>New workshops</h3>
  <p>Whilst the UK government advises the public to social distance, there will be no new darkroom workshops scheduled until it's deemed safe to do so.</p>

  <h3>Already booked upcoming workshops</h3>
  <p>If you've booked onto a recent upcoming workshop, you will have received an email with a suggested reschedule date later in the year. Contact me on the details below if you've not received the email.</p>

  <h3>Darkroom hire for members</h3>
  <p>Since the use of the darkroom is a solitary activity, members can still book into the dakroom for their own use.</p>
  <!-- <h2>Booking details</h2>
  <p>Please note, your booking is only confirmed once you've paid. I'll send a link to pay online as soon as I've received your request. I'm at liberty to give the booking to someone else if you haven't paid for a few weeks and not responded to emails.</p>
  <p>If a booking is cancelled up to 7 days before the workshop date, you will receive a full refund.</p> -->

  <!-- <h2>Gift voucher holders</h2>
  <p>If you have been gifted a darkroom voucher, you can also book yourself on to one of the available dates below. Alternatively, <a href="mailto:info@lightbox.photo">get in touch</a> to arrange an different date.</p> -->
